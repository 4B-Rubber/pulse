# Folder sizes in tile, icon and content views

Tiles, medium/large/extra-large icons and Content show the sum of logical file lengths beneath each filesystem directory.
This is not allocated disk space: sparse/compressed files and hard links follow
per-entry logical-size semantics. Small icons, List and Details retain their existing labels.

`FolderSizes` owns one low-priority worker. The UI supplies visible source rows;
the worker round-robins up to 32 resumable scans in 12 ms / 256-entry slices with
a 4 ms pause. These are scheduling budgets, not guarantees on individual filesystem
calls. Directory I/O and persistent-cache I/O never run on the window thread.
Removing visible requests cancels their generation and requests cancellation of
pending synchronous worker I/O. Scans cannot publish into a replacement request.

Local fixed disks scan automatically. UNC paths, mapped network drives and removable
media require clicking the size label. Network/driver latency can still delay a
worker operation; first-time enumeration of very large trees is not instantaneous.

The cache retains up to 4,096 directory totals in `folder_sizes.json` in Pulse's
data directory. On restart, cached totals are explicitly stale until revalidated.
Recursive local watches invalidate affected ancestors; updates are debounced by
200 ms. Watched complete results are reused, with a 60-second fallback freshness
window when no active watcher covers them. Dropping a watch invalidates its cache.
Cache writes are ignored by the cache's own watcher to prevent a feedback loop.

An empty folder is `0 B`. Unreadable roots never become a false zero. Unreadable,
offline or skipped reparse subtrees produce a partial result; root reparse points
are not traversed. File contents are never opened and cloud directory placeholders
are not hydrated. A failed refresh retains any old value with an explicit cached
label. Manual, cached, partial and unavailable labels can be clicked to retry.

The first choice for local indexed NTFS folders is the index service's MFT/USN
backend. It builds directory aggregates from existing metadata once (linear in
index entries), retains directory totals only, and propagates subsequent USN size
changes along the old/new ancestor chains. Moving a directory transfers its cached
subtree total without enumerating descendants. Snapshot replacement resets the
aggregates; ordinary volume visibility polling does not. No MFT parsing or volume
access is added to the UI process.

Indexed totals are explicitly labeled **Index estimate / 索引估算** because the
filename index can exclude entries and records one indexed name per MFT record
(hard-link aliases need not match directory-enumeration totals). Clicking an estimate
requests the existing exact directory scan, whose result is retained for that visible
scope. Both methods measure logical lengths, not allocated space.

Requests use versioned, bounded batches over a cancellable dedicated pipe, off the
window thread. Visible estimates refresh about once a second. Missing/older services,
uncovered paths, unfinished snapshots, offline volumes, uncaught-up journals and
journal gaps fall back to background enumeration. Index recovery restores the fast
path. Late replies cannot overwrite a replacement scope or a manual exact scan.
Pipe failures have a 10-second retry backoff; an unresponsive request times out in
approximately 750 ms and cancellation does not wait for that timeout.

Targeted validation: build Pulse with `PULSE_WITH_SELFTEST=ON`, set
`PULSE_SELFTEST_CASE=folder-sizes`, and run `pulse.exe --selftest`, waiting for exit.
The test uses isolated files, exercises real recursive watches and cache reloads,
checks view-model wiring and size-label hit tests, and saves wide/narrow screenshots
at 100%, 125%, 150% and 200% in both themes under `bench_data/folder-sizes`.
This case also exercises the real pipe client against an isolated controlled server:
index updates, unavailability/recovery, exact-scan override and stalled cancellation.
Run `pulse_index_engine_test.exe --folder-sizes-only` for MFT metadata aggregation,
production USN application with real fixture-file sizes, moves/deletion, coverage,
gap handling, overflow/cycle rejection and a 200,000-file / 10,000-update benchmark.
